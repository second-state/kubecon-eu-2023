# Create a complete 3-tiered microservice with Docker+Wasm

## What you will learn

* The way to develop wasm-based microservices
* How to use Docker+Wasm to run Wasm containers side by side with Linux containers

## Configure your environment

All you need to do is download the [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/). The version of Docker Desktop shpuld be at least 4.5.

## Get the source code

Git clone or fork the [second-state/microservice-rust-mysql](https://github.com/second-state/microservice-rust-mysql) project. This is a database-driven web application with one WasmEdge "container" for the entire web service (microservice), and two Linux containers for supporting services â€” one for the MySQL database and one for NGINX to server the static HTML page for the frontend UI. Wasm container runs along side with Linux containers.

```
git clone https://github.com/second-state/microservice-rust-mysql.git
```

## Build, share, and run this application

Nagivate to the cloned microservice-rust-mysql project.

````
cd microservice-rust-mysql
````

Then, use docker compose to build, share, and run the applictaion

```
docker compose up
```

## Test

Open the URL http://localhost:8090 in a browser and create a sample order to test it.
